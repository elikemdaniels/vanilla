# Simple Tailwind Starter

This is a simple Tailwind starter project using the Tailwind CLI. It is meant to be used as a starting point for your projects. I use this for all my WordPress projects.

## Usage

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Watch or build the CSS file:

```bash
# Watch for changes
npm run watch

# Build once
npm run build
```
